## Will Birdseye

I am an ex-teacher trying to fervently prove that the old addage of "Those who can't... teach" doesn't apply to me. I have been a successful and dedicated educator (with a specialism in the teaching of computing) that spent over a decade helping others reach their potential and introduced computing and coding curriculum changes to a generation developing both their, and my own, love of technology and its potential to support lives. Within this time it has been a privilege to develop passions and the decision to pursue my own within web development. My interest in coding dates back as far as writing lines of script in my teenage years to make the playing of online text-based MUD games easier to win and the child-like enthusiasm and competitiveness within this interest has only grown and developed over the years rather than diminished. 

I have been excited to extend my self-directed study through my acceptance to the 12 week intensive Makers Academy coding bootcamp, and through the completion of this course feel more capable to take on a junior developer role.
